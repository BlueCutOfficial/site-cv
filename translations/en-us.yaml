      label: "Bewilder House"
      intro: "You wake up in a strange fun house that plays with your perception and seems determined to keep you trapped. The only way to escape will be to solve spatialization-related puzzles (and stay alive) through an original use of first person controls. \"Good luck, Mister Grown up\"."

      about: "As tradition dictates at Supinfogame school, students dedicate their last year to producing a qualitative game prototype, by team of 5 or 6 members. Bewilder House is my final yeear project. The original concept's author is Robin Vallery. Along the year, everyone in the team appropriate the concept. Together, we made Bewilder House the game it is."
      trailerUniverse: "First universe trailer realised with 3DS Max during the project development. The goal was to give a first idea of the atmosphere of the final prototype (you can see what the clown looked like a looooong time ago ^^)."
      gd1: "Bewilder House is a first person puzzle game with loss of reference and observation as key features."
      gd2: "The player is lost in a maze composed of identical rooms and an invisible way out. They own a maze's map the indicates two information: the exit location and icons representing references present in the maze; and that's it, the player ignores their own position."
      gd3: "Therefore, the player explores the maze to find the references in order to understand where they are on the map and where the invisible exit should be. Then they must reach the exit room and Â« reveal Â» it with a control button."
      gd4: "However, the maze has a really strange behavior : doors open and close when the player doesn't look at them, making impossible to locate oneself thanks to previously taken ways, as these ways constantly move."
      universeIntro: "Our universe was built around three key points:"
      universeContent: "<li>Reinforce loss of reference through an environnement playing with perceptions.</li><li>Reinforce the feeling of confinement by setting the action in a closed place.</li><li>Reinforce the feeling that the maze is playing with the player and make it a living entity through the usage of the fantastic genre.</li>"
      universeConclusion: "This way, in Bewilder House, the player explores a strange funhouse containing treadmills, moving mechanisms, objects switching their location when they are not in the field of view, scary clownish faces."
      minoteam: "<strong>Why does our development team's name is Minoteam ?</strong>"
      minotaure: "Because the original concept was called \"Minotaure\" (Minotaur)! The name of the game changed during the development, but the team chose to keep their original name."

      label: "Do You Speak Digital ?"
      intro: "A gamified COOC (Corporate Online Open Course) about new technologies and Internet developed with AXA Groupe."
      about: "Do You Speak Digital ? is a gamified COOC Fremen Corp developed for/with AXA Groupe. It's about \"digital\". Throught videos and quiz, users are invited to learn about themes like search engines, personal data, new technologies... The project was developed and deployed by AXA in 2015 and employees participation was really good."
      tech: "This short project, developed within two monthes, is the very first Web project I lead on my own, from A to Z, using a JS framework. At this time (I was a junior, I had started to work for less than a year), I had chosen Backbone JS. Delays were very short, I had never used a JS framework before and no experienced developer was there to guide me, so I needed a framework easy to adopt from my small experience as a Unity developer. Backbone's MVC pattern looked well identifiable to me, I found my marks. My choice must have been right as the project was delivered in time :)"

    homeplay:
      label: "Homeplay"
      intro: "Homeplay project is an application consiting in a main remote controller allowing a user to configure different connected devices in their house."
      apis: "The application targetted iOS and was developed with Objective-C. The interface consisted in a uniq remote controller allowing to configure different type of devices. On the technical side, different APIs had to work in parallel in order to register and control each device. For instance, the application consumed Parrot's public API (to indicate house plants needs), Netatmo's API (whose sensor communicate the temperature or the quality of the air), and integrated Philips Hue' SDK (to create colored atmospheres with a couple of Hue lamps.)"
      limitations: "Homeplay' specifications went with constraints, making the application itself a simple proof of concept. First, it was about checking how far it could go without using an external server. This constraint quickly reached limitations, as it was impossible to preprogram actions (for example at work, before going home). Indeed, the iPhone had to receive house's wi-fi to control devices. Besides, the diversity of providers APIs and SDKs implied case by case integration, and some devices as Parrot connected sprinkler required a specific communication like a given type of Bluetooth. A user interested in what Homeplay offers would not necessarily see any interest in purchasing new devices."
      context: "The project was initiated by Ecometering company, who charged FremenCorp to implement it."
